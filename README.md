# R-exercises
This repository serves as a compilation of my exercises in R language. It is all fun here, no specific projects with a concrte aim exist as of now.
Each file is a stand alone routine. It can be executed with command 
> Rscript <scriptname.R>
The codes are commented, each of the file will get more and more advanced examples as I go on with my learning.
